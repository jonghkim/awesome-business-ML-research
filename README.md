# Awesome Machine Learning & Business Research
*Work-in-Progress*

A curated list of awesome machine learning research for academic journals in business.

The purpose of this repository is not to provide a full treatment of the many topics related to machine learning for business. Rather, it is intended to give an overview and cover the interesting topics in Information Systems and Marketing so that the reader is guided towards the relevant references. Specifically, I covered following academic journals in business. 

- Information Systems
    - [Information Systems Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/isre)
    - [MIS Quarterly](https://www.misq.org/)

- Marketing
    - [Marketing Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mksc)
    - [Journal of Marketing](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jmx)
    - [Journal of Marketing Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mrj)
    - [Journal of Consumer Research](https://academic.oup.com/jcr)

The number of papers dedicated to machine learning in business is rapidly increasing. Thus, this repository is designed to serve as a short and non-exhaustive review of the literature.
