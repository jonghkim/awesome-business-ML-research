# Awesome Machine Learning & Management Research
*Work-in-Progress*

A curated list of machine learning (ML) research in academic management journals. 

The purpose of this repository is intended to give an overview and cover the interesting topics in **Information Systems** and **Marketing** to serve as a short and non-exhaustive review on the intersection of ML and management research. In particular, I explored these two fields since they have historically served as the technical interface for conventional business school disciplines. Specifically, I mainly covered the following academic journals:

- **Information Systems**
    - [Information Systems Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/isre)
    - [MIS Quarterly](https://www.misq.org/)
    - [Management Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mnsc)

- **Marketing**
    - [Marketing Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mksc)
    - [Journal of Marketing](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jmx)
    - [Journal of Marketing Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mrj)
    - [Journal of Consumer Research](https://academic.oup.com/jcr)
    - [Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science](https://www.springer.com/journal/11747)

## Table of Contents
Papers in top journals often make contributions across many topics so I classified them according to their key contributions.
