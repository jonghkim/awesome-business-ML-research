# Awesome Machine Learning & Business Research
*Work-in-Progress*

A curated list of awesome machine learning (ML) research for academic business journals.

The purpose of this repository is not to provide a full treatment of the many topics related to machine learning for business. Rather, it is intended to give an overview and cover the interesting topics in Information Systems and Marketing to serve as a short and non-exhaustive review of ML-Business literature. Specifically, I covered following academic journals in business. 

- Information Systems
    - [Information Systems Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/isre)
    - [MIS Quarterly](https://www.misq.org/)
    - [Management Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mnsc)

- Marketing
    - [Marketing Science](https://pubsonline.informs.org/journal/mksc)
    - [Journal of Marketing](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jmx)
    - [Journal of Marketing Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/mrj)
    - [Journal of Consumer Research](https://academic.oup.com/jcr)

I particulary explored these two fields since they have historically served as the technical interface for conventional business school disciplines, still the number of papers dedicated to machine learning in other business domains is also rapidly increasing.
